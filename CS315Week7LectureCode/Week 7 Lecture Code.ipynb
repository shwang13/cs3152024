    "## 1. Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains several packages that we are using for the first time. Additionally, we might need to use these packages for the project too, thus, it's good if we install them within the virtual environment of the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we install the packages within Jupyter, they are installed in our system-wide Python installation. We need to take some extra steps to ensure that the new packages are installed for our project-specific virtual environment. Here is what you need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that you have created the virtual environment for Project 2 (about collecting data with PykTok). You can find the instructions under Week 7 Programming Activities.\n",
    "2. Open a terminal window, navigate to the folder where you created your virtual environment, and then type `source .project2/bin/activate`.\n",
    "3. Install the following package: `pip install ipykernel`, to manage virtual environments within Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "4. Register our virtual environment with Jupyter: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.project2 --display-name=\"CS315 Project2`\n",
    "5. At this point close this notebook and then restart it again.\n",
    "6. When you reopen the notebook, find the button \"Python 3 (ipykernel)\" on the top right corner. Click on it, you should see the following dialog, where you should select our virtual environment that we gave the display name CS315 Project2: ![Screenshot: Kernel selection](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~eni/cs315/choose-kernel.png)\n",
    "7. Before moving on, run the cell below, just to make sure that you are really running the virtual environment."

    "\n",
    "We discussed that having to pick k is a limitation of K-means clustering. Below, we show one method known as the Elbow method to try to pick the best k. If you want to learn about the method, here is [a short 4-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht7geyMAFfA) to explain it. It is called the Elbow method because k is selected at the lowest point that marks something that looks like an elbow. This is the point where the sum of squared distances from the cluster centroid stops decreasing rapidly and enters a phase of a constant-paced decline, toward 0. This sum of squared distances of all points from the cluster centroid is known as inertia. "
